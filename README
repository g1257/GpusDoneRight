GpusDoneRight is a collection of C++ classes (in .h files)
to simplify the programming of GPUs.
We are using the low-level driver API, so that the
code is standard C++ without ``decorations.''
We are using the CUDA driver API, although other APIs might
be added in the future. 
GPU kernels go in a separate .cu file; they are usually
compiled using nvcc into a .ptx file.

Quick Start.
