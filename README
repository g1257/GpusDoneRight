GpusDoneRight(tm) is a collection of C++ classes (in .h files)
to simplify the programming of GPUs.
We are using the low-level driver API, so that the (CPU)
code is standard C++ without ``decorations,'' or language extensions.
We are using the CUDA driver API, although other APIs might
be added in the future. 
GPU kernels go in a separate .cu file; they are usually
compiled using nvcc into a .ptx file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dependencies:
* GNU C++ compiler
* The low-level driver API, i.e., basically the cuda.h include
file and the library libcuda.so
* the nvcc compiler to create the .ptx file for the GPU kernel(s). 
* PsimagLite ( https://github.com/g1257/PsimagLite/ )

Quick Start.
cd examples/
make simpleQuery
./simpleQuery
make addTwoVectors
./addTwoVectors

What's not done right.
Unfortunately, NVIDIA and ATI GPU architectures are closed. Therefore, the
GPU kernel(s) cannot be written in C, or in C++ (or in D...).
They have to be written in NVIDIA's proprietary language extensions, and
compiled into a .ptx file with nvcc.
However, all this is isolated to the kernel code only. All our GpusDoneRight
wrapper is standard C++ (without language extensions)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A request for NVIDIA and ATI:

We, as developers, kindly request that NVIDIA and ATI release the specs
of their GPUs so that GNU C/C++ developers (and others) can generate 
GPU kernel code with their backend compilers.
This way, everything will be done right(tm).
