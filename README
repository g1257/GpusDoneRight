GpusDoneRight(tm) is a collection of C++ classes (in .h files)
to simplify the programming of GPUs.
We are using the low-level driver API, so that the
code is standard C++ without ``decorations.''
We are using the CUDA driver API, although other APIs might
be added in the future. 
GPU kernels go in a separate .cu file; they are usually
compiled using nvcc into a .ptx file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dependencies:
* GNU C++ compiler
* NVIDIA SDK for GPUS (in principle only the low-level driver API include
files and libraries like libcuda.so, also the nvcc compiler to create
the .ptx file)
* PsimagLite ( https://github.com/g1257/PsimagLite/ )
* Some hardware with some kind of new model GPU to go with the SDK, I suppose
