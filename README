GpusDoneRight(tm) is a collection of C++ classes (in .h files)
to simplify the programming of GPUs.
We are using the low-level driver API, so that the (CPU)
code is standard C++ without ``decorations,'' or language extensions.
We are using the CUDA driver API, although other APIs might
be added in the future. 
GPU kernels go in a separate .cu file; they are usually
compiled using nvcc into a .ptx file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dependencies:
* GNU C++ compiler
* The low-level driver API, i.e., basically the cuda.h include
file and the library libcuda.so
* the nvcc compiler to create the .ptx file for the GPU kernel(s).
* PsimagLite ( https://github.com/g1257/PsimagLite/ )
* (optional) The NVIDIA SDK is helpful because 
our examples use some kernel and data files from the NVIDIA SDK. 
You can find and copy these files manually or you can run
perl addNonIncludedFiles.pl

Quick Start.
cd examples/
make simpleQuery
./simpleQuery
make addTwoVectors
./addTwoVectors

What's not done right.
Unfortunately, NVIDIA and ATI GPU architectures are closed. Therefore, the
GPU kernel(s) cannot be written in C, or in C++ (or in D...).
They have to be written in NVIDIA's proprietary language extensions, and
compiled into a .ptx file with nvcc.
However, all this is isolated to the kernel code only. All our GpusDoneRight
wrapper is standard C++ (without language extensions)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A request to NVIDIA and ATI:

We, as developers, kindly request that NVIDIA and ATI release the specs
of their GPUs so that GNU C/C++ developers (and others) can generate 
GPU kernel code with their backend compilers.
This way, everything can be done right.
